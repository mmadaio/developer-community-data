# Online Developer Community Survey Analyses
Analyses of online developer community surveys for the UNU-CS Gender Tech Lab


## Overview

Online developer communities boast millions of users - over 29 million on GitHub and over 8 million on Stack Overflow, in 2018. Participation in these communities is becoming one of the primary ways software developers learn new programming languages, improve their skills, develop collaborative projects, and find new job opportunities. (David and Shapiro, 2008; Ford et al., 2016; Vasilescu et al., 2015)  

Developers on these sites may ask and answer coding questions to improve their skills (e.g. Stack Overflow), use those skills to contribute to open-source code (e.g. GitHub) and participate in coding challenges (e.g. HackerRank). These platforms are becoming increasingly important to hiring decisions, as recruiters look at GitHub contributions or reputation on Stack Overflow as indicators of developers' skill.

However, despite the promise for these online developer communities to support software developers in their professional development, there are indicators that there may be serious difference in women and men's participation in these communities - differences which may further exacerbate existing gender gaps in the ICT workforce writ large.


### Research questions

To understand the extent and nature of the gender gap in online developer communities, we ask the following research questions:

1. How do male and female developers differ in their participation in online developer communities?
2. How do male and female developers differ in their perceptions of belonging and kinship in online developer communities?
3. How do male and female developers in online communities differ in their employment and prior experience with coding?


### Data
We use surveys from 3 major online developer communities:

- Stack Overflow [survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/) (download latest survey results [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1_9On2-nsBQIw3JiY43sWbrF8EjrqrR4U))
- GitHub [survey](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) (download latest survey results [here](https://github.com/github/open-source-survey/releases/download/v1.0/data_for_public_release.zip))
- HackerRank [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/hackerrank/developer-survey-2018/home) (download latest survey results [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hackerrank/developer-survey-2018/))
